Example SciChart application that triggers multiple dependency property changed
events by simply nesting a chart modifier inside a modifier group.

This example is a modified version of the [Databinding Annotations with
MVVM](http://www.scichart.com/databinding-annotations-with-mvvm/) example.

The changes from the original example can be seen
